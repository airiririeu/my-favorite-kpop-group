                        they released their album "The book of us: Demon" with their title track "Zombie" written by the members itself. Unlucky, DAY6 aren't active as a group these past years because of they have
                        to serve their military services. </h4>

                        their songs, actually, I improved a lot in terms of dancing because of TWICE. I'm really proud being a once (twice's fandom) since 2018 and I will continue to look up and love them in the future.

                    <h4>I started to stan (G)I-DLE when we tried to do a dance cover to their song "oh my god". I certainly fell in love with their concepts and songs. I also love their personality and how they do their
                        fan services. Sadly, one of their members- soojin, left the group due to false accusations about bullying. Authorities already claimed that this issue was false, but the company (G)I-DLE signed in
                        still considered to terminate Soojin's contract and exclude her from the group.

                        that's why I stan them. I felt like I'm in comfort whenever I listen to their songs. I miss my boys, now that their contract already expired, they are on their own, and also has their own
                        solos, I'am still looking forward to their comeback as 7 members.
